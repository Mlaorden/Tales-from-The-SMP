				<h5>~ The Village That Went Mad ~</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="body-content">
				<p>The Village That Went Mad is the second installment of Tales from the SMP. It was streamed on January 2, 2021 at 8 PM EST and starred Karl Jacobs, BadBoyHalo, Corpse Husband, Dream, GeorgeNotFound, LazarBeam, Ponk, Quackity, and Tubbo.</p>
				<p>The story took place hundreds of years before the current-day Dream SMP and followed the eight townspeople of "Not A Very Good Town" town (all except Karl). The villagers roleplayed Town of Salem (also known as Mafia), where each person was assigned a role. Each night, the murderers killed someone, and during the day, the townsfolk gathered to figure out who the murderers were before they wiped out the entire village. Karl acted as the gamemaster, narrating what was happening as well as murdering/executing on behalf of the murderers/townspeople.</p>
				<p> The winners of the had a chance to win $1000.</p>

				<h6>First day</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="body-content">
				<p>During the day, the townsfolk met at the well at the center of the village.</p>
				<p>During the night, Helga slept in Miles' house. They made a lot of noise, so many of the villagers did not get enough sleep. Cornelius was murdered during the night while in the same house as Catboy.</p>
			</div>

				<h6>Second day</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="body-content">
				<p>During the day, the townsfolk discovered Cornelius was dead and held a meeting around the campfire. Catboy revealed that he felt the murderer's presence, but was unable to identify them because he was blind. The other townspeople, including Bob the builder and Mayor Jimmy, immediately questioned this, and Catboy admitted that it could have been him. Helga made fun of the conversation and the other people, but also put suspicion on the orphan Robin.</p>
				<p>Although Catboy defended Robin, the townspeople put Robin, Catboy, and Miles Memington on the chopping block. Catboy repeated that he could be the murderer and Robin revealed that he was the Jester in their defenses. (Miles Memington just repeated his name.) Catboy received the most votes and was executed. Because he had always been Robin's father figure, Robin became distraught and stayed in the jail cell for the night.</p>
				<p>During the night, the murderers chose not to kill anyone.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="header-content">
				<h6>Third day</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="body-content">
				<p>During the day, the townsfolk gathered around the campfire and realized Catboy might have been telling the truth about his blindness. Helga attempted to convince the depressed Robin to speak in his defense before the townspeople executed him, as Robin had been the closest person to Catboy. Robin put suspicion on Jimmy.</p>
				<p>The town sent Robin and Jimmy onto the chopping block. Robin did not defend himself and only hung his head in sadness. Robin received the most votes and was executed, joining Catboy in the afterlife. Karl revealed that Robin was indeed the Jester, so he had won. However, the game would still continue.</p>
				<p>During the night, Helga went stargazing alone on the rooftops and was murdered. With her death, the murderers achieved dominance against the innocents, so Miles and Jimmy (the remaining innocents) were also murdered in their homes.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="header-content">
				<h6>Fourth day</h6>
			</div>
			<div class="body-content">
				<p>During the day, only Jack and Bob came out of their houses. Karl revealed that they were the murderers, and had won the game. Since Robin, the Jester, had also won from getting executed, the three of them split the $1000 prize.</p>
